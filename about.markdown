I'm a software engineer living in Stockholm, Sweden.
You'll find posts about technology I'm looking into, problems I stumble upon at work
and a bunch of other things - tightly or loosely coupled to the engineering profession.

Cloud-native & "full-stack" - but I'd prefer keeping my hands a few feet away from a beautiful UI at the moment ;)

Currently working at [Creator Studio](https://www.creatorstudio.com) with a focus on backend in Python.
