I’ve been spending the last couple of years working quite intensively with javascript. Or, mostly typescript, but in essence javascript. Let’s just say it’s been a while since I had to switch my comfort-ecosystem out!

Since September however, I made a bit of a switch moving into a python-driven backend team here at Creator Studio (an awesome team, might I add).

Here are some of my lessons learnt so far;

- An ecosystem is just that.

Most of the things you already know should be applicable to a new ecosystem. This does not really hold up if you went too bananas into becoming a “react-developer” or whatever the latest hype is. Learn your foundations, and build from that! You’ll notice that there might be new terminology, but the core is still programming, architectural decisions and logic being applied. The language (should) not be the hard thing here!

- Ask for help

You know that feeling that you can get sometimes if you go too deep on something, and then have to turn around because you’ve made some incorrect assumptions early without investigating the options? That will happen a whole lot more ******now. Make sure you get help, ask for help, and learn from that help as soon as possible to remove wasted time. I’m not saying you shouldn’t test your wings anymore, but be responsible about it.

- Apply your experience

Sometimes switching ecosystems means you’ll have new applied ways of working, patterns or just common solutions. It also means you might have some new ideas on how things could be done - and sometimes these ways might be really good. Share your experience!
